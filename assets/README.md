# milijunth-portfolio-page

Once again trying to make a portfolio page for myself that I will maybe like // HTML, CSS, vanilla JS

- this time i will be documenting my process for future references (of mine)

1. Made project structure as for any simple website made with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS: in projects directory there is index.html file, and then one directory called "assets" in which are three more folders, "css", "images" and "js"; that will probably change sometime soon, tough.

2. Made some photos (with my phone) of some random code I wrote some time ago, those will serve as showcase photos for my skills. I chose parts of code that look cool with all the colors and that are general enough not to be look to much into. Then I did some photo-editing magic (ok, I just messed with brightness and contrast to get black-background with colored words on it) with the intention to get that "I'm cool, clean and carefree code" vibe.
